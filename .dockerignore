test.py # Example if it's a scratch file

*.zip # If data.zip is large and only used for initial setup and then ignored

# Ensure setup.py, requirements.txt, and source code (src, api, main.py, config) ARE NOT ignored
# The .dockerignore works by exclusion, so if a parent is ignored, children are too unless explicitly un-ignored
# (which is complex). It's better to ignore specific large/unneeded top-level items.
