       "\"This essay will analyze, discuss and prove one reason in favor of keeping the Electoral College in the United States for its presidential elections. One of the reasons to keep the electoral college is that it is better for smaller, more rural states to have more influence as opposed to larger metropolitan areas that have large populations. The electors from these states are granted two votes each. Those from larger, more populated areas are granted just one vote each. Smaller states tend to hold significant power because their two votes for president and vice president add up more than the votes of larger states that have many electors. This is because of the split of the electoral votes. Some argue that electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most votes nationally. They do not have to vote for their own state's nominee unless their state has a winner take all system. However, there are states that have adopted laws that force their electors to vote for their state's candidate. It seems that, no matter how, electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most nationally. This is not always the case because of state legislatures who can overrule the electors and vote for the alternative candidate their citizens have selected for them, even if the voter lives in a state without a winner take all system.\""
